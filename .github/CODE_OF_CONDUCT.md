# BriteCore Open Source Code of Conduct

## 1 - Introduction
BriteCore’s team and community is made up of professionals located all around the world. While diversity is one of our strengths, it can also lead to communication issues. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask that our community adhere to in order to ensure that working within the BriteCore community is pleasant and productive.
This code of conduct applies to all communication with BriteCore. Violations of this code may affect a person’s ability to contribute to our community.

## 2 - Guidelines
### 2.1 - Be Welcoming
BriteCore strives to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, family status, political belief, religion, and physical ability.
### 2.2 - Be Considerate
Our open source work is used by other people and in turn you will depend on the work of others. Architecture and code choices will affect others. We must support the diverse workflows and configurations of all users.
### 2.3 - Be Respectful
Disagreements around approach, commenting, style, tooling, and architecture are inevitable in open source. When disagreements occur, present your opinion respectfully and productively. We might all experience some frustration now and then but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. The free exchange of ideas depends on a healthy dialogue rooted in mutual respect.
### 2.4 - Be Careful in Word Choices
We are a community of professionals and we strive to conduct ourselves professionally. In a text based community it’s easy for meanings to get lost; assume good intent by default and be kind to others. Cite observable facts when possible instead of feelings or generalizations.
### 2.5 - Be Understanding
Disagreements, both social and technical, may happen in a large and growing community. Strive to address disagreements and differing views constructively. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## 3 - Examples
A few examples of statements that could fall under this code of conduct:
> Your code sucks.
* Instead try: _This section of code {link to section} violates the following design principles… I think it’d be cleaner if we approached it like this:_

> Push my prs through the code review process faster.
* Instead try: _What steps can I take to ensure a speedy review?_

> I’m not going to make that change.
* Instead try: _Where can I review guidelines for why this is an important change?_

## 4 - Violations
We encourage individuals to try to understand one another individually and privately before making a complaint. We recognize that some violations may be of such nature that any subsequent interactions with the individual(s) would be unwise or imprudent. If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it to a maintainer of this repository. Violations of this code may affect a person’s ability to contribute to BriteCore’s open source community.

## 5 - Adjudication
Upon receipt of a complaint, our maintainers will review, investigate, and update both the accused and accuser on the status of the complaint. Accused persons will be given the opportunity to explain themselves. The maintainers will provide such opportunity with due diligence to the right of privacy and respect to both parties.
